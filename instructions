Write a node.js scraper to scrape the following data from https://www.bbc.co.uk/news 6 times between 6am and Midnight UK time every day.

Scrape the following data from every new article on the page:

- Article link
- Article headline text
- Article image URL (if there is one)
- Article published time and date
- Article excerpt text (if there is one)
- Article author (if there is one)
- Article category (if there is one)

You can ignore all the articles in the "Best of BBC section".

Store the data in a JSON file in a new object for each day.

Update the data for the current day 6 times.

Please can you add the script to my Vultr account:

Username: chrisjb@gmail.com
Password: GrogerPower9

Once you have the script running, please send me the URL of the JSON file.

Thank you
